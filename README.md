# Executive Summary: Nutritional Analysis of USDA Food Data

## Objectives:

The prior objective of this analysis was to derive insights from the USDA'S FoodData Central database, encompassing 7,793 common foods. The focus was on identifying foods rich in Vitamin C, understanding the nutritional composition and exploring the caloric contributions of different macronutrients.

## Key Findings:

1. **Vitamin C Content:**
    - The fruit with highest Vitamin C content is Acerola (West Indian Cherry) with a concentration of 1677.6mg per 100g.
    - Other sources of high Vitamin C content are Babyfood items top of the list with 2732.0mg of Vitamin C per 100g.
2. **Relationship between Calories & Water:**
    - A negative correlation exists between the water and calorie content of food items. Foods with higher water content generally contain fewer calories.
3. **Drawbacks of Zero-Carb & High-Protein Diets:**
    - Eliminating carbohydrates can lead to nutrient deficiencies, especially in fiber and vitamins typically found in fruits and vegetables.
    - A very high-protein diet, can lead to nutritional imbalances and health issues, such as kidney strain and heart health risks.
4. **Macronutrients Caloric Contribution:**
    - A linear model confirmed that fat contributes approximately 9 kilocalories per gram, and protein and carbohydrates contribute around 4 kilocalories per gram, aligning with the estimates provided by the Cleveland Clinic.
    - The model revealed that items with alcohol, fiber and sugar alcohols have caloric contents that deviate from predictions based solely on fat, protein and carbohydrate content.

## Conclusion

The analysis underscores the complexity of nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet. While macronutrients play a key role in determining calorie content, other factors such as alcohol, fiber, and sugar alcohols also contribute significantly. Dietary choices should be made considering the full nutritional profile of foods to maintain health and well-being.
